# sample_code

I have used github and gitlab for the last 3 years, but my activity has been on private accounts for my research lab and for the courses I have been a teaching assitant.  We have to keep our user data private as well as the materail used for grading the courses.  

I have collaborated with other other graduate students on code and feel comfortable using git for this purpose.  I have provided a few files from grading scripts and research projects I have worked on.
